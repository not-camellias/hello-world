    <p>Hello World! My name is Camille and I am an ATEC senior ready to take on Internet Studio! :) <br />
      What I am interested about in Net Art and design is how versaltile the medium is and how diverse the works are, especially since I focus more on utility as a UX designer.

    <h3>Camille's Selections from the CWD Index </h3>
    
    <ol>
    
    <li><a href = "https://iknowwhereyourcatlives.com/cat/bcf73f6ede">I Know Wheere Your Cat Lives</a> (2014) by Owen Mundy.<br />
    What I like about Mundy's feline site is how it presents a commentary on how easy personl data can be shared and tracked, in the cutest way possible.</li>

    <li><a href = "https://datawillhelp.us/">Data Will Help Us</a>  (2013) by Jonathan Harris.<br />
    What I like about Harris' manifesto is how he juxtaposes the use of data with what it cannot replace.</li>

    <li><a href = "https://www.onamountaintop.com/">On a Mountain Top</a> (2010) by Alex Fuller.<br />
    What I like about Fuller's site is how collaborative it is despite the simple interface.</li>
