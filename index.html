    <p>Hello World! My name is Camille and I am an ATEC senior ready to take on Internet Studio! :) </p>
    <h3>Camille's Selections from the CWD Index </h3>
    
    <p>First Pick: <a href = "https://www.camelliasgrace.com/">I Know Wheere Your Cat Lives</a> (2014) by Owen Mundy.</p>
    <p>What I like about Mundy's feline site is how it presents a commentary on how easy personl data can be shared and tracked, in the cutest way possible.</p>

    <p>Second Pick: <a href = "https://datawillhelp.us/">Data Will Help Us</a>  (2013) by Jonathan Harris.</p>
    <p>What I like about Harris' manifesto is how he juxtaposes the use of data with what it cannot replace.</p>

    <p>Third Pick: <a href = "https://www.onamountaintop.com/">On a Mountain Top</a> (2010) by Alex Fuller.</p>
    <p>What I like about Fuller's site is how collaborative it is despite the simple interface.</p>
